## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections has given a set of election results of the local congressional election to be analyzed.  The request was to determine the winner of the election and the breakdown of the results by candidate and county.

  - Araphahoe County: 24,801 (6.7%)
- Based on the results the county with the most votes cast was Denver County with 82.8% of the votes.

## Summary
This analysis successfully summarized the results of the election and the important details requested.  For future use the file may be modified to determine vote counts based on different jurisdiction than counties.  This will make the analysis more versatile for the many different levels of elections such as city elections or national elections.  The file will also need to be modified to allow for other determinates besides popular vote to be used to determine the winner of an election.  The analysis could also be modified to allow for the breakdown of candidate votes by county to see how successful candidates where in each of the counties which can be used by future campaigns.
